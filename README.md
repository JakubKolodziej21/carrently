# Carrently

Carrently is a mobile application for car rental management, developed as part of an engineering thesis project. The app enables users to browse available cars, manage rentals, and handle payments, all within a secure and user-friendly environment. Built using Flutter, Firebase, and Firestore, Carrently provides seamless authentication, real-time data handling, and payment processing integration.

## Project Purpose

The project demonstrates proficiency in creating scalable and responsive mobile solutions with a focus on user experience and reliability.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login, registration, and Google Sign-In integration powered by Firebase Authentication.
- **Car Browsing and Rental Management**: Real-time updates from Firestore allow users to browse available cars and manage their current rentals.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrated payment tracking with options for online payment or BLIK, including real-time payment status checks.
- **Dynamic Calendar View**: Displays current rental schedules, allowing users to navigate their rental history easily.

## Screens

- **Welcome Screen**: Initial screen with the app logo and welcome message.
- **Login/Register**: User authentication screen for signing in or registering.
- **Car List**: Displays a list of available cars, including model, brand, and cost per day.
- **Rental Management**: Enables users to view and manage current rentals with the option to finalize rentals.
- **Payment Screen**: Shows payment history and provides options for online payment.
- **Settings**: Allows users to adjust app preferences, including language, notifications, and account security.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: Install Flutter from [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/).
- **Firebase Project**: Set up a Firebase project with Authentication, Firestore, and Storage. Add the necessary collections (`cars`, `rentals`, and `payments`).
- **FlutterFire CLI**: Configure Firebase in the project using the FlutterFire CLI:

    ```bash
    flutterfire configure
    ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/carrently.git
    cd carrently
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. Set up Firebase configurations:

   - Ensure the `firebase_options.dart` file is generated by the FlutterFire CLI.
   - Configure Firestore collections (`cars`, `rentals`, `payments`) to match the app's requirements.

### Usage

To start the app, run:

```bash
flutter run
 ```
## Configuration

Ensure the Firebase collections in Firestore have the following fields:

- **Cars Collection**: Holds details about available cars.
  - Fields: `brand`, `name`, `cost_per_day`, `delay_fine`, `fuel_type`, `gearbox`, etc.

- **Rentals Collection**: Stores rental records linked to a user.
  - Fields: `user_id`, `car_id`, `date_start`, `date_end`

- **Payments Collection**: Tracks payment records.
  - Fields: `user_id`, `date`, `price`, `type` (e.g., rent)

## Project Structure

- **Authentication (`auth.dart`)**: Manages user authentication, including email and Google Sign-In.
- **Screens**:
  - **WelcomePage**: Entry point of the app with options to log in or register.
  - **LoginPage**: User login and registration screen.
  - **MyHomePage**: Main navigation screen with tabs for browsing cars, rentals, payments, and settings.
  - **RentalsScreen**: Allows users to view and manage current rentals, including ending rentals.
  - **SettingsScreen**: Provides configuration options such as language, notifications, and security.
- **Firestore Services (`firestore_service.dart`)**: Handles interactions with Firestore, like fetching car and rental data.
- **Models**:
  - **Car**: Represents car details.
  - **Rental**: Holds rental information.
  - **RentalWithCar**: Combines Rental and Car details for display.

## Firebase Initialization

The app initializes Firebase using platform-specific configurations provided in `firebase_options.dart`, which is generated by the FlutterFire CLI. Ensure Firebase is set up correctly before running the app.
